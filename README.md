# Homework 3

My homework 3 is pretty cool. I added some cool things like a clipboard
and returned to some CSS to format things. My homework has met the following
criteria:

- generates a random passowrd with numbers, letters, and special characters
- allows user to choose the generation criteria
- copy code to their clipboard

## Creative differences

I may have completed this assignment in a different way than expected. It was brought to my attention that this assignment might be testing for use of the window.prompt() and window.confirm() methods to collect the user criteria. Instead, I created a form in the HTML and used event listeners to hide and display content as I pleased. I think that the way I did it looks better, but I can redo the assignment with these methods if that's what you wish.
